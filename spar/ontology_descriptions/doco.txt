#description **DoCO**, the **Document Components Ontology**, is an OWL 2 DL ontology that provides a general-purpose structured vocabulary of document elements. DoCO has been designed as a general unifying ontological framework for describing different aspects related to the content of scientific and other scholarly texts. Its primary goal has been to improve the interoperability and shareability of academic documents (and related services) when multiple formats are actually used for their storage.

The creation of DoCO was undertaken by studying different corpora of documents (mainly scientific literature and web documents on different topics) and publishers' guidelines, from two perspectives â€“ the structural and the rhetorical. In addition, some informal interviews have been done with researchers in different fields and with academic publishers, in order to gather as much information as possible about document components and their use.

DoCO imports the [Pattern Ontology](http://www.essepuntato.it/2008/12/pattern) that describes structural patterns (introduced in the paper entitled "[Dealing with structural patterns of XML documents](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.23088)"), and the [Discourse Element Ontology (DEO)](/ontologies/deo), which was developed with DoCO and describes rhetorical components. Additionally, it also defines hybrid classes describing elements that are both structural and rhetorical in nature, such as paragraph (``doco:Paragraph``), section (``doco:Section``) or list (``doco:List``). DoCO is also aligned with the [SALT Rhetorical Ontology](http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/vocabs/sro) and the [Ontology of Rhetorical Blocks (ORB)](http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/hcls/notes/orb/). A concise summary of the main DoCO classes and its imported ontologies is shown in the following figure.
