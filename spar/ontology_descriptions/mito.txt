#description MiTO, the Mention Typing Ontology, is an ontology developed using OWL 2 DL (Web Ontology Language 2 Description Logic), a W3C standard for creating formal ontologies. Its primary aim is to provide a framework for the formalization of the concept of mentions, which are explicit or implicit references to entities, concepts, or other information within a text or discourse. Through MiTO, it becomes possible to define the type of mention in a precise and standardized way, thereby facilitating semantic analysis and the processing of information
